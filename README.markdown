# ExColor - The jquery color picker plugin.
## A fork of the modcoders\_excolor plugin for jquery.

[Modcoders\_excolor](http://modcoder.org/?ptab=jquery&item=excolor) is a color picker with some really great features, but slightly lacking in documentation and functionality ( no rgb input/output method for instance, and the default style isn't the greatest. ) So I've taken the code, converted it to coffeescript, and now i'm working on adding that missing feature, and improving the style.

Work has only just started, so you know - give me a while before you start using it.

Yours,
